      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am an Internal Medicine physician-in-training with a strong interest in aerospace medicine,
        hyperbaric and dive medicine, and medical education. My work bridges clinical practice,
        research, and innovation, with an emphasis on understanding and supporting human health in
        extreme and operational environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my training, I have been involved in multidisciplinary projects, ranging from
        spaceflight-related physiology and fluid shifts to operational challenges in remote and
        austere care. I enjoy collaborating across disciplines and working with teams that span
        medicine, engineering, and the life sciences.

      <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of clinical and academic life, I enjoy scuba diving, spending time in coastal and
        mountain environments, and working on creative projects such as logo and patch design that
        reflect my interests in exploration and spaceflight.
